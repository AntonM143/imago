We have created a easy to use e-commerce site where we sell posters under the brand “Imago''. On the page you can choose between different categories and then select the specific product. Once at the specific product page, you also get to make a choice on which size you want to buy. Then you go to the shopping cart, get a summary of which products you added to the shopping cart, here you can also change the quantity of the products you added. Then you go ahead and fill in your contact information and make a choice of shipping method. And finally, you move on to complete the purchase.
We have learned to create a complete e-commerce with a technology stack containing NextJS, MongoDB and nodeJS. And through agile methods be able to set up a plan with a sustainable structure to be able to build an e-commerce with a focus on user-friendliness and a simple purchase flow.

A proposal for further development is to add more categories and products. As well as adding promotions and discounts, eg three for two, etc. Another idea is to add a newsletter, where the customer gets a discount if they sign up. eg 10% on the next purchase. Also add "my pages" where the customer can easily see their old orders and manage returns.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.


## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
